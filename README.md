# Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to my Data Analysis repository! This repository contains two projects that showcase my data analysis skills using PostgreSQL and Python. Each project is contained in its respective folder and includes a detailed analysis performed using various tools and techniques.

## Projects Overview

### 1. 10 Best-Selling Video Games Data Analysis (PostgreSQL)
- **Folder**: `PostgreSQL_projects`
- **Description**: This project analyzes the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. The goal is to determine trends and insights using a dataset that includes game sales, critic reviews, and user reviews.
- **Tools Used**:
  - PostgreSQL: for storing and querying the dataset
  - Python: for data manipulation and analysis
  - Jupyter Notebook: for interactive data exploration and visualization
- **Files**:
  - `10_best_selling_video_games.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis
  - `queries.sql`: SQL queries used for data extraction and transformation

### 2. Basic Data Analysis Using Python
- **Folder**: `Python_projects`
- **Description**: This project performs basic data analysis using Python, utilizing libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. It serves as an introduction to data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Tools Used**:
  - Python: for data manipulation and analysis
  - Pandas: for data manipulation
  - Numpy: for numerical operations
  - Matplotlib: for data visualization
- **Files**:
  - `basic_data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis


### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:
- Python (version 3.6 or above)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PostgreSQL (for the video games project)
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, psycopg2
